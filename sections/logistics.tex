\section{Logistics}

The summer school requires a large amount of kit to be moved around in order to facilitate the activities.
This generates a large amount of logistics activities that need to be planned in advance in order to minimize effort during the week.

\subsection{Estates transportation assistance}

The bulk of the heavy items are needed in the cube.
In order to minimize the amount of heavy lifting required estates and facilities can move the equipment from the cupboard to the cube and back at the end of the event.

The Initial move to the cube needs to be done in several blocks in order to work with the pottering teams schedules.
The kit for the arena construction needs to be sorted so that the kit arrives in the cube by the time it is needed.
The details of what kit is being moved when then needs to be sent to estates so that they can bring the appropriate kit to move the kit.
The return move is done in a similar manner with the initial move on Friday afternoon and the remainder moving on Monday.
