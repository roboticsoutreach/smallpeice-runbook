\section{Kits}

The main equipment used by the teams during the summer school is are the robotics kits.
The kits contain the core electronics and control components needed to build the robots.
There will need to be one kit per team plus spares. a 25\% spares ratio to give a good saftey margin.
Kit numbers can drop a bit below this without issue as this avoids the need to make small board orders.

\subsection{Testing kit}

In order to ensure there is enough kit for the summer school it should be tested and inventoried far in advance of the summer school.
There are test scripts and procedures for all of the boards and parts in the kits.
Any shortages or kit parts should be added to the ordering list.

\subsection{Kit software}

The software for the kit will likely need updates and improvements.
These will need including into the software image and appropriate testing.
The docs should also be updated if any user facing changes are made.

\subsection{Kit packing and preparation}

Before the event the kits need to be packed into boxes for the teams to use.
In addition a demobot needs to be prepared for showing during the introductory talk.
