\section{Volunteers}

At around April time work to invite and select volunteers from Sourcebots for helping run the summer school is required.
This needs to be done late enough so that those with summer internships know what their status is over the summer.
The number of volunteers required needs to be worked out at this time and the number of volunteers limited to this amount.
Table \ref{tab:volunteerroles} shows the main roles and numbers required for those roles to give an idea of how many volunteers are needed.

    \begin{tabular}{cc}

        \hline
        Organisation lead & 1 \\
        Team mentors & 1 per two teams \\
        Labs Lead & 1 \\
        Workshop supervisors & 2 \\
        Arena build team & 3\\

\subsection{Catering and accommodation}

At around June we will need to confirm to Smallpeice which volunteers require accommodation or have dietary requirements.
To do this we need to work out who is around for what days as we will need a good number of the volunteers on the weekends before and after.
Historically as well as the course days we have been able to get accommodation on the Saturday and Sunday before and the Friday and Saturday afterwards for volunteers who are available then.
